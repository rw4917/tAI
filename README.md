bio-tAI
=======

This is a Python implementation of the popular tAI metric, originally
implemented by [mariodosreis/tai](https://github.com/mariodosreis/tai).
It should be more extensible though perhaps not faster.

If there are codons that are composed of non-ATGCU 'bases', they will be
silently ignored from analysis.

There will be small differences in the calculation compared to the original
codonR program (O(1e-3)).

These may be the result of a mis-coding in the original data table used in the
codonR code, which assigns 1 tRNA to `TGA` (a stop codon), which wouldn't be
right. Based on the known tRNAs in *E. coli*, `TGA` may have been unknowingly
swapped with `TGT` keeping it together with the other stop codons in the coding
table.

## Making releases

1. Reconcile package requirements in `requirements.txt` with those listed at
`install_requires`, `setup_requires`, and `test_requires` in `setup.py`.

2. Confirm build passes all tests

2. Update the version number and `download_url` in `setup.py`

3. Tag a release on GitHub with the new version number
